Toward the close of the third of the show's eight episodes, though, Hacker alone held the spotlight. Wearing faded jeans and a peasant blouse, this 29-year-old single mother from Muscle Shoals, Ala., had just poured her heart into a down-home rendition of Bonnie Raitt's hit "I Can't Make You Love Me." The crowd was on its feet, lavishing her with the most emphatic applause given to anyone all night. </P> <P> The camera panned to Hacker's 8-year-old son, holding a sign that read "Vote for My Mom," before zooming in on the judges' table. When it came time for the final member of the panel, the country singer Blake Shelton, to weigh in, he said: "I don't know if you're going to win this thing or not. You could, but I promise you one thing: When you make your first album -- and you will -- I'm going to be one of the first people in line to buy that thing." </P> <P> Shelton's response was earnest, if pat, yet it also hinted at the strange curse that has plagued the winners of "Nashville Star," which is broadcast live from the Acuff Theater in Nashville's Opryland complex on Thursday nights at 10. Unlike Fox's "American Idol," the show has yet, after four seasons, to see any of its first-place finishers establish themselves as major artists. In fact Hacker may actually be better off not winning. </P> <P> That was certainly the case for Miranda Lambert, the only indisputable success story "Nashville Star" can claim. After placing third during the first season, she parlayed the exposure into a record deal with Sony BMG. "Kerosene," the CD she released in 2005, made its debut at the top of Billboard's country album chart. The record has since gone platinum, signifying sales of 1 million copies, and its title track was nominated for a Grammy Award. </P> <P> Meanwhile the winner that year, Buddy Jewell, has already been dropped by his label after a disappointing second album, though his debut CD did moderately well, selling more than 500,000 copies and producing a couple of hit singles. None of the winners who followed Jewell have sold half as many albums or had a song in the country Top 10, although Jeff Boggs, an executive producer of "Nashville Star," said he still had high hopes for last season's top finisher, Chris Young, who records for RCA. </P> <P> "I think it's disastrous that there hasn't been a winner to go on to be a consistent star in Nashville," Shelton said recently. "In order for the show to have credibility and for it to take another step, we need a Carrie Underwood to come out of it." The reference was to the hugely popular country singer who finished first on the 2005 edition of "American Idol" and won a pair of Grammy Awards earlier this month. </P> <P> Tracy Gershon, vice president for artists and repertory for the Nashville division of Warner Brothers Records and a judge in the first two seasons of "Nashville Star," agreed that the show's long-term success hinges on producing a star of Underwood's magnitude. Gershon has a professional stake in the matter: her label will be responsible for making an album with this year's winner. "It's absolutely crucial that the talent level comes up and that the show really breaks a big artist," she said. </P> <P> The current season's contestants were drawn from 20,000 auditions held in a dozen cities. Among the most promising candidates are the Hackers, both of whom sing with the soulful quality associated with the music of their native Muscle Shoals, the town where Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett recorded some of their landmark hits. Then there is David St. Romain, a 28-year-old from Baton Rouge, La., with a smoky, R&amp;amp;B-inflected voice who may be the show's most well-rounded entertainer. Whitney Duncan, 22, a photogenic singer from Scotts Hill, Tenn., has carried herself more like a star than anyone else on the show (although apparently that wasn't enough; she was voted off just over a week ago). The winner will be announced on Thursday's episode, viewers having cast votes by telephone or on the show's Web site (usanetwork.com	usanetwork.com	1461	1

Overall our bookings are holding up quite well." </P> <P> One component of the current economic downturn - the falling value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies - may actually be helping cruise lines. Europe is a hot destination for cruisers this year, likely because travelers are learning that the falling U.S. dollar makes a land-based trip to Europe quite expensive. </P> <P> "If you want to go to Europe and take a cruise, you pay for your lodging, most of your food and your transportation between locations in U.S. dollars," Sharak said. "With the value of the dollar falling, American tourists in Europe might stop at a sidewalk cafe for coffee and a light meal and the bill is something like $90. With a cruise, people are insulating themselves against the cost of a vacation to Europe." </P> <P> Since 1980, the number of cruise passengers has grown steadily, averaging about 7 percent a year, an impressive record that includes weathering a number of other past economic downturns, as well as the drop in travel following the 2001 terrorist attacks. </P> <P> Last year the industry enjoyed another solid performance, sailing at 105 percent capacity, a figure made possible because capacity is rated at two persons per stateroom and many families often bring along kids who stay in the room with them. </P> <P> The industry has responded to its steady growth by building new, often-larger ships and adding activities, entertainment and better dining options. Cruise lines have also focused on the family market, hiring counselors who run day-long activities for kids, giving harried parents time to enjoy themselves on their own without worrying what their children are up to. </P> <P> The 23 member lines in the Florida-based trade group	Florida	1514	1

He was 57. </P> <P> Sonn, who became president of world cricket's governing body in June 2006, had been in critical condition in a Cape Town hospital since May 21. </P> <P> The ICC paid tribute on its Web site to Sonn, describing him as instrumental in unifying South African cricket after years of racial segregation during apartheid by helping the nation return to the international fold. </P> <P> "As a cricket administrator and a man, Percy Sonn was a giant," said his predecessor Ehsan Mani. "Cricket will be much the poorer for his passing." </P> <P> The ICC said it would issue a statement in due course on election procedures to find his successor, and will in the interim appoint an acting president. </P> <P> In March, Sonn was invited to extend the standard two-year term by one after a deadlock at a board meeting over the two potential successors, England's David Morgan and India's Sharad Pawar. </P> <P> Sonn devoted much of his life to cricket, although never played beyond local level. His administrative career began while a teenager in the apartheid era, working his way up to become vice president of the South African Cricket Board and then president from 2000-03. He became ICC vice president in 2004. </P> <P> "Percy was utterly committed to the game at all levels and his mantras were that the game had to be inclusive rather than exclusive, and that it had to be played the right way, to be true to the spirit of cricket," ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said. </P> <P> "He relished the fact that this year's World Cup took place in the Caribbean because the nine countries that hosted the tournament mirrored the game's diversity on a worldwide level, something he saw as a real strength." </P> <P> Australia's World Cup-winning captain, Ricky Ponting, expressed shock and sadness at Sonn's death. </P> <P> "I will always associate Percy with one of the happiest moments of my career as he was the man who handed over the Cricket World Cup trophy to the Australia team at the end of the tournament in Barbados last month," Ponting said. </P> <P> A trained lawyer, Sonn worked as an advocate, served as Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions, and was a legal adviser to the South African Police Service. </P> <P> He also formed and headed the Directorate of Special Operations in South Africa, known as the Scorpions	Percy Sonn	1770	1
